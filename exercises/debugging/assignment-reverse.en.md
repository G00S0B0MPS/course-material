# Fix Reverse

The file `reverse.py` contains a buggy implementation of a list-reversing algorithm.
Fix the implementation so that the tests pass.

::::IMPORTANT
Make minimal changes, i.e., don't just implement it as `xs.reverse()`.
Pretend `lst.reverse()` and `reversed(lst)` don't exist and that the algorithm has to be implemented from scratch.
::::

::::TASK
Fix the code in `reverse.py`.
