# Loops vs Recursion

Why do we need recursion if we already have loops?
Is recursion perhaps more powerful in some way?

It can be shown that loops and recursion are actually equally powerful: any algorithm relying on loops can be rewritten to use recursion, and vice versa.
So, admittedly, recursion is definitely not *necessary*.

Recursion can, however, be very useful.
There are many problems that are much easier to solve using recursion.
So, in the end, it's mostly a matter of using the right tool for the job.

Now, you might think that you didn't really get the feeling that recursion simplified things considerably.
We cannot really disagree.
Unfortunately, recursion only starts to really shine when dealing with more complex problems.
Until now, we preferred giving you relatively simple problems to solve, and even though loops would do, force you to use recursion.
We now introduce problems that are actually difficult to solve using loops but easy using recursion.
