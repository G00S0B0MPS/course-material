# Assignment

:::TASK
Write a function `middle(a, b, c)` that returns the "middle" element, i.e., the element that is neither the highest nor the lowest.
:::

::::INFO
This is a trickier exercise, more of a riddle.
It's okay not to be able to solve this one, but resist the urge to peek at the solutions.

For the more advanced students: you're only supposed to use what you've learned so far.
Using conditionals makes this exercise much easier, but that's cheating.

:::USAGE

```python
>>> middle(2, 10, 4)
4

>>> middle(6, 7, 5)
6
```
