# Sum of Inputs

We want a little script that helps us taking the sum of a series of numbers.
The script should repeatedly ask us for numbers until we enter `0`, after which the script outputs the sum.

::::TASK
Write a function `sum_input()` that performs the task described above.

::::USAGE

```python
>>> sum_input()
Enter integer: 1

Enter integer: 4
Enter integer: 0
The sum equals 10.
```
