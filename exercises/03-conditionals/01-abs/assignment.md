# Assignment

:::TASK
Write a function `abs(x)` that returns the absolute value of `x`.
:::

:::USAGE

```python
>>> abs(5)
5

>>> abs(-1)
1
```

:::

:::INFO
Admittedly, Python comes with the `abs` function built-in.
In practice, you wouldn't bother implementing your own, but it makes for a good exercise.
