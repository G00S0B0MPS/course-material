# Parsing Positions

We revisit our RTS game.
In a previous exercise, you implemented a function that turned an (x, y) position in a string.
Now it's time to implement the inverse operation: given a string, extract the values for x and y from it.

This is slightly more complicated to implement than `parse_date`, as these strings have a less rigid structure.

:::TASK
Write two functions `parse_position_x(string)` and `parse_position_y(string)` that take a string and return the x-coordinate and y-coordinate, respectively.
Examples are shown below.
:::

:::USAGE

```python
>>> string = "(12, 9)"
>>> parse_position_x(string)
12

>>> parse_position_y(string)
9
```

:::HINT
Parsing a position involves multiple steps.
To implement such algorithms, you'll want to find ways to strip away complexity.

* A possible first step would be to get rid of the enclosing parentheses.
  These are always at fixed positions, so this should be easy.
  This way, you have reduced the problem from parsing `(x, y)` to parsing `x, y`.
* You need to know where both `x` and `y` start and end.
  There's a special character separating the two.
  Find its position in the string.
* Given the index of the separator, you are able to partition the string in a left part (where `x` is stored) and a right part (where `y` is stored).
* As a last step, you need to convert from string to `int`.
