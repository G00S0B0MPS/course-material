## Checking Your Python Installation

Itâ€™s important to check that your Python installation actually works.
There are two kinds of problems that can arise:

* Python cannot be found
* The wrong version of Python is found

Below are instructions that verify both at the same time.
The goal is that you get Python to tell you which version it is, and that this version is 3.11 or higher.
If you encounter problems, inform a lecturer.

**IMPORTANT**

> A `$` in the beginning of a line means that you should input that line in a shell.
> Do not write the `$` itself though, only what follows.
> For example, `$ ls` means you should type `ls` followed by enter.
