# FAQ

**I found a small mistake in the course material. Who do I tell about it?**

Create an issue [here](https://github.com/ucll-programming/course-material/issues).
You only need to copy the sentence in which the mistake occurs, we can easily search through the entire material for that sentence.
You should preferably also indicate what the mistake is.

After we fix it, we will close your issue.
You can then download the updated version of the course material following [these instructions](workflow/update-course-material.md).

**I don't like the location where I stored my course material. How do I move it elsewhere?**

You can freely move the course material around on your drive.
[This page](troubleshooting/relocating.md) explains how.

**I work with multiple machines. How do I set up the course material so that it's always synchronized across all machines?**

Follow [these steps](workflow/two-machines.md).

**I've switched machines. How do I transfer all my solutions to the new machine?**

Start by making sure that all your work has been [committed and pushed](workflow/commit-all-files.md) on your old machine.
Next, if you follow all [installation instructions](installation/index.md) on your new machine, you should end up with an up-to-date version of the course material, including your solutions.
