# Python Installation (MacOS)

The most recent Python version can be found [on the Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Download and install it.
If need be, you can always look on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/36Uu4Gn_A3o?t=112) for extra help.

{% include checking-python-installation.md %}

Open a terminal in the `scripts` directory.

```bash
$ python3 check-python-installation.py
```

If the output ends on `SUCCESS`, you can proceed with the [next step](python-packages.md).

**IMPORTANT**

> In all further instructions, we will just use `py` to run Python scripts, but you will have to replace `py` by `python3`.

## Next Step

[Install Python packages](packages.md).
