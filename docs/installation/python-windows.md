# Python Installation on Windows

The most recent Python version can be found [on the Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Download and install it.

{% include python-installation-shared.md %}

Open Git Bash in the `scripts` directory and enter.

```bash
$ py check-python-installation.py

If the output ends on `SUCCESS`, you can proceed with the [next step](packages.md).
