## Progtool

In a terminal, enter the two commands shown below.
As always, omit the `$`.

```bash
$ pipx ensurepath

$ pipx install git+https://github.com/ucll-programming/progtool
```

Close the terminal and open a *new* terminal in the same directory in which you have downloaded the exercises.
Enter

```bash
$ progtool setup
```
