# Git Installation on Linux

## Checking For Pre-Existing Installation

In a terminal, write

```bash
$ git --version
```

If you are shown a version number, Git is already installed and you can jump to the [Configuration section](#configuration).

## Git Installation

The installation depends on which Linux distro you're running.
We refer you to this [page](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).

{% include git-configuration.md %}

## Next: Python

Proceed with the [installation of Python](python-linux.md).
