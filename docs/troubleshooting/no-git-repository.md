# No Git Repository

If you were referred to this page by the assistant tool, it means the assistant tool was unable to find a Git repository.

* Either you're not running `progtool` while inside the repository.
  Make sure to open the shell in the right location.
* You didn't clone the repository, but merely downloaded it.
  Please follow the instructions.
